# üßæ Healthcare Claims Accuracy and Reporting ‚Äì VBA Automation Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the validation and reporting of healthcare insurance claims using **VBA in Excel**. It simulates a real-world medical billing process by identifying missing fields, flagging duplicate claims, and generating audit-ready reports. The solution is inspired by workflows seen in healthcare analytics firms to improve operational efficiency and accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**
- Conditional Formatting
- Pivot Tables and Charts

## üìÇ Dataset Structure (Sample Fields)

| PatientID | ProcedureCode | BillingAmount | ClaimDate | Status     | Remarks        |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 1001      | P100            | 4500           | 2024-05-10| Approved   | -              |
| 1002      | P101            |                | 2024-05-12| Pending    | Missing Amount |
| 1003      | P100            | 4500           | 2024-05-10| Duplicate  | Same as 1001   |
